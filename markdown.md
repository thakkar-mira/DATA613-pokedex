The Generation I Pokédex RShiny App is **Ruby and Mira's RShiny project** for Professor Dickens's DATA613 class. Our RShiny app is based off of the data we scraped for our graduate student project. Our app allows users to explore generation I Pokémon using the data from our graduate webscraping project. We created the following three widgets:

1.  **Pokédex:** A dynamic table listing out the battle statistics of all Pokémon from Generation I.
2.  **Poké-Pics:** Users can select Pokémon from dropdown menus to bring up pictures of the Pokémon's normal and shiny forms.
3.  **Poké-Plots:** Users can create scatterplots of any battle statistic against each other. Plotly functionality allows for users to easily identify any outlying Pokémon.

We also have a **Resources** tab, where users can find references and threads that helped us troubleshoot our app, the libraries we used, and our code for our graduate web-scraping project. For any questions, please reach out to us directly:

**Mira**: mt7562a\@student.american.edu

**Ruby**: pl8485\@student.american.edu

### We hope you enjoy our Poké-app!
